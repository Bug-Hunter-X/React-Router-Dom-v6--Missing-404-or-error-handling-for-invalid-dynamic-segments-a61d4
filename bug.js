In React Router Dom v6, navigating to a route with a dynamic segment that doesn't exist can cause unexpected behavior. For example, if you have a route like `/users/:userId` and try to navigate to `/users/invalidUserId` where `invalidUserId` doesn't match the expected data format or correspond to an actual user, it might not trigger a 404 or render a proper error component. This can lead to silent failures or unexpected rendering.
