This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router Dom v6 related to handling invalid dynamic route segments.  When navigating to a route with a dynamic segment that doesn't exist or doesn't match the expected data format, the router might not behave as expected. This example shows how to implement proper error handling and 404 routing to improve the application's robustness and user experience. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic behavior, while `bugSolution.js` offers a solution using error boundaries or a custom 404 component.
